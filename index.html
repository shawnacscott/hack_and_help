    <p>
      Hack + Help is a free, community-based user group for anyone in the Portland, Oregon area wanting to level up their technology skills. Whether you're new to coding, or just want to pick up a new language, framework, or tool, Hack + Help is the place to do it!
    </p>

    <p>
      This group was born out of <a href="http://pdxruby.org/">PDX.rb</a>, but Hack + Help has now been rebooted as an independent, language agnostic group as of 2014. While we highly encourage peer-to-peer teaching, Hack + Help regularly has experienced attendees who are willing to help you out with Ruby, JavaScript, Python, HTML/CSS, and more. Bring your laptop and desire to learn and teach!

          <li>Learning cohorts</li>
            <p>
              Want to learn a new skill with the accountability and support of a class, without all the lectures and cost? Learning a new skill in isolation is challenging, so if you have a topic you'd like to learn more about, come join us to learn together!
            </p>
          <li>Presentation nights</li>
            <p>On presentation nights, you can expect 20-30 minutes worth of lightning talks or interactive workshops. Participation is always optional, and we'll have space available for those who need to focus!</p>
